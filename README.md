# Ramjet-Engine-Calculator
Analyses the variation of propulsive and thermodynamic efficiency for a ramjet engine with various input parameters

This [figure](https://github.com/SergiuIliev/Ramjet-Engine-Calculator/blob/master/figure_ramjet_engine_stations.png) presents the Ramjet Stations naming convention.

The code is thoroughly commented and explained, yet for additional reference and *sample output* please see the report available on ResearchGate titled: [Ramjet Engine Performance Parameters Calculator - Advanced Propulsion Design Report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317037111_Ramjet_Engine_Performance_Parameters_Calculator_-_Advanced_Propulsion_Design_Report)
